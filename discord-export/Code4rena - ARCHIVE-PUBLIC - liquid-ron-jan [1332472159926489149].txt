Sorry if it's an obvious question, but is there a RON.sol or WRON.sol contract?


[01/29/2025 09:30] whoismxuse
Hi @Owl are we supposed to consider the logic of the mock contracts in scope since they are called by  the `scope.txt` contracts ?


[01/29/2025 09:35] pfapostol
top 3 or 5 of this contest. Check in the docs for more info.

Hey all!
Been trying to answer all your question via private threads! Hope everything is going well for you wardens!

One more public clarification worth mentionning:
**Currently the Ronin chain is permissioned**, meaning only whitelisted addresses can deploy contracts. The liquid ron protocol will at some point deploy new contracts to function nominally. 
**However, Ronin is going permissionless in february**

**Liquid RON protocol will be deployed after this change occurs**

As always, I'm here for all your questions!

That happens when you have 2 versions of Vm.sol I believe


[01/30/2025 19:03] keivou
Which I also think happens if you installed foundry twice in different ways, like running the cargo and also the curl, do you remember doing this?


[01/30/2025 19:07] unique0x0
yeah I did that a long time ago but this is the first time this has occurred


[01/30/2025 19:08] unique0x0
I can run `cargo` command in my terminal


[01/30/2025 19:08] keivou
Not sure if this works but you could try finding one of the Vm.sol and deleting it, otherwise uninstall and reinstall through cargo, but it'll take a while

So just to be sure, is it fine to assume that `finaliseRonRewardsForEpoch` will be called roughly every 10 mins.


[01/30/2025 21:00] owlofmoistness
nope, `finaliseRonRewardsForEpoch` has nothing to do with the ronin staking epochs
the vault's epochs are unique to the vault
`finaliseRonRewardsForEpoch` will be called a couple times per weke if necessary, ideally it should be called rarely

Makes sense now..


[01/31/2025 02:04] elser17
I do not get why Escrow contract is required for avoiding miscalculations. When somebody deposits in LiquidRon with native RON it is just wrapped into WRON and sent to the Escrow, which justs deposits on behalf of receiver. Would not this be the same as just wrapping the native RON and calling deposit(msg.value, msg.sender)?


[01/31/2025 02:20] t0x1c.c0de
You need to fetch the totalAssets() **before** the user deposits so that shares can be calculated for minting.
Not using Escrow means the protocol would erroneously include the just transferred WRON balance.

Both functions return assets to user (if all checks pass)

In `withdraw`, the user specifies the amount of assets to withdraw, and the function calculates the corresponding shares to burn

In `redeem` the user specifies the amount of shares to burn and the function calculates the corresponding assets to return to user

[02/02/2025 20:13] unpluggedtj
If I understand correct, do you mean users / admins / validators will be interacting to contracts via EOA? 
Yes, you can always consider that, even consider multisigs or smart wallet contracts ( it doesn't mean these wallet contracts don't have the ability to receive native tokens, don't consider user mistakes )


[02/02/2025 20:14] godwinudo
Yes, that's what I mean


[02/02/2025 22:14] owlofmoistness
Yup 
Anyone able to receive Ron if they are a user 
For operator can be both eoa or contracts

        liquidRon.deposit{value: amount}();
        uint256 delegateAmount = amount / 7;                          <<<<<@

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            amounts[i] = delegateAmount;
        }
        liquidRon.delegateAmount(0, amounts, consensusAddrs);
        skip(86400 * 365 + 1);
        uint256 pre = address(this).balance;
        uint256 prel = liquidRon.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 assets = liquidRon.redeem(390 ether, address(this), address(this));
        uint256 post = address(this).balance;
        uint256 postl = liquidRon.balanceOf(address(this));
        assertTrue(prel - postl == 390 ether);
        assertTrue(post - pre == assets);
    }
```


[02/04/2025 07:30] welith
if you look at the test asserts, you will see it does not really make any difference, so it's most probably a typo


[02/04/2025 07:37] topmark1
and it might even be on purpose just to ascertain that redeem works even if the entire balance is not delegated


[02/04/2025 07:40] unique0x0
if you change that to 5 the test will fail 
`ERC20InsufficientBalance `


[02/04/2025 07:44] welith
it will fail cause you will be delegating the whole vault amount in the staking contract, so you will need to do a request for withdrawing

[02/04/2025 08:25] topmark1
hmm, why is that


[02/04/2025 08:32] welith
well, when you deposit your funds can be delegated to the staking contract, so you won't always be able to do full withdraws, that's why you have the request withdraw option, so that the operator can undelegate funds from the staking contract, in order to pay your request

Definitely some stuff that needed to be corrected in my code.
I've been told it isn't common practice to discuss stuff jsut after competition end so I'll leave it at that

again status changed to post-judging QA what did this indicates ?


[02/24/2025 20:45] pfapostol
The judge looked at the escalations, something was looking valid, but he didn't have enough information or something like that so they gave extra time to the PJQA. So that the wardens could provide additional information or answer questions.

Keep in mind that this audit contained a High with >70 duplicates and a Medium with >200 duplicates, so awards for those findings will be very low or $0.

so the results page does not show all people who submitted the vulns but only a subset of them?

it shows all people who submitted valid vulns


[02/28/2025 08:36] tinnohofficial
am pretty sure the vulns i submitted are valid but I guess i have to wait.


[02/28/2025 08:36] alekso1
You would be in the results page if it was valid. Maybe your vulns are valid but your report is too low quality to be accepted. Yep have to wait anyway you won't be able to escalate without SR role


[02/28/2025 08:37] tinnohofficial
something similar once happened in TraitForge when i was starting out to audit, I submitted a valid Low, it was part of the report but I never saw my handle in the report or the past findings tab ü§î


[02/28/2025 08:38] pfapostol
no


[02/28/2025 08:39] tinnohofficial
so how do they invalidate the findings, do they leave a comment or sth or they just leave your reports in silence üòÖ


[02/28/2025 08:43] pfapostol
I believe there will be an open repo in github with all the reports, after contest finalized, maybe not, there is a lot of changes currently in Code4rena. 
Check if you have access to the dashboard panel in the upper right corner of the contest page. If not, write me a DM, I will send the comments from your findings.

There is a problem with the leaderboard.....I already confirmed i have 1 high and 1 medium finding, and there is only 1 high finding, how come i getting paid less than people who have just 1 high finding(not like it matters), and i am placed below them on the leaderboard. @CloudEllie


[03/01/2025 05:54] pfapostol
https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards
TLDR:
There is a share calculation system and you get more if you find more unique findings, there is also a bonus, 10% of the total pot for the ones who finds the most amount of valid findings, and 10% for the ones who finds the most unique amount of findings.

In this particular contest it looks like you would have to find all 1H and 2M to get a decent reward amount as they all have a lot of duplicates.
There is also a chance that you only receive part of the reward if the quality of the report is poor.


[03/03/2025 04:54] thehxnz
any eta on full report?

Hi guys I had shadow audited this codebase after the contest just for practice,  and just a heads up I think there might be a bug with the `pruneValidatorList` function where the parameters of `IRoninValidator.getReward`  external call made might be reversed. I didn‚Äôt see this mentioned in the report, so I thought I‚Äôd flag it in case it‚Äôs actually a bug. It‚Äôs been a while since I last reviewed the codebase tho, was just comparing my findings with the report and think there might be a typo in the parameters(?)


[03/19/2025 15:36] attentioniayn
Made me curious so I checked, but it seems to just be a harmless typo in the interface (aka they called user what is actually the validator).
If you check the validator contract it should be correct: https://github.com/ronin-chain/dpos-contract/blob/348e2e364fb9d63faa116dd61ea71a1161578fd7/contracts/ronin/staking/RewardCalculation.sol#L30

@CloudEllie  Hi, upon reading the report now, I see something distressing. It seems that I submitted a valid  bug that's in the report, but my name is not there, I didn't get any reward nor points. I'm talking about this bug => https://code4rena.com/reports/2025-01-liquid-ron#m-02-operators-are-unable-to-perform-any-actions-due-to-incorrect-modifier-implementation

I'm looking at my submitted findings, and I saw and submitted this bug. Could you please look into this, what went wrong? For more info: I did submit is as high, and it is considered a medium in the report. Does c4 directly invalidate bugs in this manner?
